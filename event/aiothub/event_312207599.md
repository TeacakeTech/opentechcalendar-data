AIoTHub (formerly IoT North) Community meetup are pleased to present Jacob Willey in "Gamechangers in Wearable Technology"

Abstract: Wearable technology has transformed from niche gadgets to mainstream innovations, driving a decade of growth and reshaping how we interact with the digital world. This talk explores the gamechangers, companies that scaled rapidly from startups to industry leaders, and examines the critical role of intellectual property (IP) in fuelling their success. We’ll uncover how wearable tech intersects with IoT and discuss emerging links to AI, highlighting how these technologies collectively enable smarter, more connected experiences. Join us to understand the strategies, innovations, and future trends that continue to redefine wearable technology.
