# The best of Python, straight to your living room

Python Unplugged is a free, online event open to everyone – whether you're new to Python or deeply involved in the community. It brings together some of the leading voices of the Python community for a day of live talks and demos – plus live chat on Discord and quizzes along the way.

Join from anywhere to watch the full day live, or drop in for individual sessions. Enjoy a conference experience from the comfort of your sofa – created by Python people, for Python people.

We'll be joined live by 15 well-known and beloved speakers from Python communities around the globe, including Carol Willing, Deb Nicholson, Sheena O'Connell, Paul Everitt, Marlene Mhangami, and Carlton Gibson. They'll be speaking about topics such as core Python, AI, community, web development and data science.
