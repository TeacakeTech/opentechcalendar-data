Each year on the first weekend in February afficionados of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and open culture gather in Brussels to meet each other, talk about their projects, and spread a cocktail of pathogens known as the FOSDEM Flu.

FluConf is intended as an alternative, online venue for those in these communities who still care about public health.
